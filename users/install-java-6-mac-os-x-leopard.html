title: Install Java 6 on Mac OS X Leopard
---

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Java 6 isn’t installed by default. Java 6 is available as a simple Software Update, so if your system is up to date, Java 6 is installed, else upgrade your system. Note that Java SE 6 won’t appear for users on 32-bit Intel machines (Intel Core and Intel Core Duo) even if their systems are fully up to date.</p>
<h3>Activation</h3>
<p>Even though Java 6 is installed, Java 5 is still used by Mac OS X. You have to activate Java 6 by yourself. To do this, you need to run :<br>
<em>Applications -&gt; Utilities -&gt; Java -&gt; Java Preferences</em></p>
<p>You will get the following window :</p>

<p>You just need to change the order of Java versions to use (Java application versions). Once Java SE 6 is on the top of the list, it should be activated.</p>
<h3>Verification</h3>
<p>You can check that Java 6 is correctly activated. You need to run a terminal (Applications -&gt; Utilities -&gt; Terminal) and to type the command: <em>java -version</em></p>
<p>You should get this message :<br>
