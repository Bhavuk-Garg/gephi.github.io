</ol>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<h3>Java 7 standard edition or newer required</h3>
<p>Check you have Java properly installed on your system. If you're on Linux, you may provide the path to the jdk with <em>./bin/gephi --jdkhome $JAVA_HOME</em></p>

<h3>JVM Creation failed</h3>
<p>This error message is due to memory settings, see following section.</p>

<h3><a name="memory"></a>Memory</h3>
<p>Memory available to Gephi is determined by Java. Less or more memory can  be allocated by configuring Gephi’s <strong>startup settings</strong>. If too less memory is allocated, Gephi will stop running when it reached the limit and you will loose your current work. If more memory than what the system is equipped with is set, Java will not be able to start and return “JVM Creation failed” message. By default, maximum memory is set to 512mo.</p>
<p>To modify memory settings, you need to edit gephi settings file. Modify the value after the <strong>-Xmx</strong> option to change the maximum heap space. For example, to use a heap size between 256 and 1024 MB, change the options to -Xms256m and -Xmx1024m. If you have Gephi open, you must close and reopen Gephi before new options take effect. On computers with 2GB of memory, you can set -Xmx1400 to get maximum performance.</p>
<p>How to edit <em>gephi.conf</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>On Windows, go to the Gephi folder in Start menu and click on Startup Settings. Edit this file with Notepad or WordPad. Alternatively, go in <em>C:\Program Files (x86)\Gephi 0.9\etc\gephi.conf</em> and edit file manually.</li>
<li>On Mac OS X, right-click on Gephi application icon and select <strong>Show Package Contents</strong> to open a new Finder window displaying a Contents folder. Open the Contents folder, and then open the <em>Resources/gephi/etc</em> folder, in which the gephi.conf file resides. Use TextEdit to edit the file.</li>
<li>On Linux, go into your application directory and then into the <em>etc</em> folder. Edit the file with a text editor.</li>
</ul>
<p>When multiple JRE or JDK are installed on the same machine, you can specifty to Gephi to use a particular path. Edit <em>gephi.conf </em>as&nbsp; described in the upper section, uncomment the <em>jdkhome</em> line and set the JRE or JDK path.</p>

<h3>User files</h3>
<p>Locate and delete gephi user directory to clean your installation.</p>
<ul>
<li>On Windows 2K/XP, user diretory is located in <code>C:\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\.gephi</code></li>
<li>On Windows Vista/Seven/8/10, user directory is located in <code>C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\.gephi</code></li>
<li>On Mac OS X, user directory is located in <code>/Users/username/Library/Application Support/gephi</code></li>
<li>On Linux, user diretory is located in <code>/home/username/.gephi</code></li>
</ul>
