<h2>About</h2>

<p>Gephi is an award-winning open source software dedicated to network analysis and visualization, known as the "Photoshop of networks". It has been downloaded more than a million times and is used by scholars and data scientists around the world.</p>
<br />
<p>Gephi allows you to visualize graph data as a map. State-of-the-art algorithms generate readable layouts where clusters and influential nodes appear. Visual tools tweak colors and shapes to reveal hidden patterns. Gephi helps you to explore the details as well as the big picture of your data, and to create the visualizations that support your narratives. Gephi's purpose is to unfold complex data in a way anyone can understand them. More and more network-maps are pictured in online and offline press and other communication media. They spread from science to business, art, and activism. People are increasingly exposed to them and learn how to read them. Gephi aims at accelerating this commoditization process by providing a free and easy way to craft and diffuse network visualizations.</p>
<br />
<p>Gephi is built by passionate researchers and engineers under common values. It’s a truly distributed open-source community that started as a student project in the University of Technology of Compiegne, France in 2008 and rapidly grew to the leading software in the field notably thanks to the Google Summer of Code program.</p>
